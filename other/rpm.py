"""RUSSIAN PEASANT MULTIPLICATION (RPM)
-----
To multiply A and B:
1. Put a smaller number A into division column and bigger number B into mutiplication column.
2. Division column: A // 2 until the number is 1.
3. Multiplication column: multiply B until the number of lines is equal to the division column.
4. From both columns remove lines where division column number % 2 == 0.
5. Sum all numbers in the multiplication column. That would be the result.

Time complexity: Î˜(log n)
