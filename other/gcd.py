"""GREATEST COMMON DENOMINATOR (GCD). EUCLID'S ALGORITHM
-----
1. If we subtract a smaller number from a larger one 
(we reduce a larger number), GCD doesnâ€™t change. 
If we keep subtracting repeatedly the larger of two, we end up with GCD.
2. Instead of subtraction, if we divide the smaller number, 
the algorithm stops when we find the remainder 0.

Time complexity: O(log n)
