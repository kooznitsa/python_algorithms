"""DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING. KNAPSACK
-----
Columns (j) are knapsack sizes from 1 to 4 kg,
one row (i) for each item:
        1   2  3  4
Guitar |__|__|__|__|
Laptop |__|__|__|__|
Book   |__|__|__|__|

Te grid starts out empty. Fill in each cell of the grid.
Once the grid is filled in, youâ€™ll have your answer to the problem.

cell[i][j] = max(
    1. The previous max (value at cell[i - 1][j])
    vs
    2. Value of current item + value of the remaining space
    (cell[i - 1][j - item's weight])
)

Time complexity: O(n * W) where W is max weight
