"""GRAPHS. TOPOLOGICAL SORTING (TOPSORT)
-----
Based on depth-first search (DFS). Using directed acyclic graph (DAG).
If we perform DFS on a DAG, we could simply sort the nodes based on their
descending finish times, and theyâ€™d be topologically sorted. Each node 
would then precede all its descendants in the DFS tree, which would be 
any nodes reachable from the node, that is, nodes that depend on the node.
